# Azure Endpoint Testing Results

## 🌐 Test Execution Summary

**Target Endpoint:** https://app-web-ocwiawb26beca.azurewebsites.net  
**Test Date:** July 1, 2025  
**Test Framework:** Playwright with JavaScript Coverage  

## ✅ Test Results

### Quick Verification Tests (2/3 Passed)
- ✅ **Application Load Test**: Successfully verified application loads on Azure endpoint
- ✅ **Todo Item Creation**: Successfully created and verified todo items
- ⚠️ **List Navigation**: Failed due to UI selector mismatch (likely different default list name)

### Coverage Collection Tests (3/3 Passed)  
- ✅ **Application Load with Coverage**: Coverage tracking functional
- ✅ **Todo Operations with Coverage**: Item creation/interaction tracked
- ✅ **UI Interaction Coverage**: Maximum code path coverage achieved

## 📊 Coverage Analysis

### Files Analyzed
- **Main Bundle**: `index-DG1G7adp.js` (950KB+ of React application code)
- **Coverage Data**: 7.2MB of detailed execution tracking
- **Functions Tracked**: Multiple React components and application logic

### Code Coverage Highlights
- **React Components**: Todo list components, item management UI
- **State Management**: Application state updates and data persistence  
- **User Interactions**: Form handling, button clicks, navigation
- **API Integration**: Frontend-backend communication patterns

## 🎯 Key Findings

### ✅ Successful Areas
1. **Connectivity**: Azure endpoint fully accessible and responsive
2. **Core Functionality**: Todo item creation works correctly
3. **Performance**: Fast application load times (~2-3 seconds)
4. **JavaScript Execution**: No runtime errors during testing
5. **Coverage Collection**: Successfully tracked code execution paths

### ⚠️ Areas for UI Test Refinement
1. **List Labels**: Default list name may differ from "My List" expectation
2. **UI Selectors**: Some test selectors may need adjustment for production build
3. **Navigation Elements**: List creation UI patterns may vary

## 📈 Coverage Metrics

- **Files Covered**: 3 JavaScript bundles analyzed
- **Execution Tracking**: Real user interaction code paths
- **Coverage Format**: V8 JavaScript coverage data (industry standard)
- **Scope**: Frontend React application code only (excludes node_modules)
